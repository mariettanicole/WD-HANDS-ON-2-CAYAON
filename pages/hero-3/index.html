                <h1>BOMB</h1>
                <p>The most explosive of the Angry Birds, with the least imagination in their name, Bomb is a trusted friend of Red and a consistent member of the team. With his destructive powers, heâ€™s one of the most well-equipped to take down strongholds and fortresses, and his fitting short-fuse attitude makes him even more of a danger to the short-snouted inhabitants of the Piggy Kingdom.</p>
